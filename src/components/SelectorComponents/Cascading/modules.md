# Cascading Filter Menus

Cascading filter menus are specified in the utils/flatfiles folder, with filenames like texas_filter_menu.json. In these files, we lay out the hierarchy of the filter menu, and the django var names and data types of the individual variables that the user can filter on. For example:

    [...
    	{
    	"label": "Itinerary",
    	"children": [
    		{
    			"var_name": "voyage__voyage_ship__ship_name",
    			"type": "CharField",
    			"label": "Ship Name"
    		},
    		{
    			"var_name": "voyage__voyage_itinerary__imp_principal_place_of_slave_purchase__geo_location__value",
    			"type": "GeoField",
    			"label": "Place of embarkation"
    		},
    		...
    	]},
    	...
    ]

When a user clicks on one of these filterable variables in the cascading menu, they see pop up a filter component generated by the appropriate component factory.
