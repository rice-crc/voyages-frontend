# Header

The Header folder contains components used for creating header elements in the application. It includes several components:

- The `CustomHeader` component is a React functional component designed to render custom column headers for data tables. It provides options for sorting data, displaying menus, and handling user interactions within the table's column header.

#

- The `DatasetButton` component is a React functional component designed to render buttons representing datasets or collections. These buttons are used to select and filter data based on the chosen dataset. The component provides customization options for button appearance and handles user interactions.

#

- `DrawerMenuBar` that renders a menu bar with items based on a given set of data. The menu bar allows the user to select a dataset, and when an item is clicked, a callback function called handleSelectDataset is invoked with specific parameters.

#

- `HeaderNavBar` is header navigation bar menu of the application. It provides a menu with navigation items, a filter search option, and a responsive mobile menu.

#

- `HeaderLogoSearch` represents the header logo and search bar of the application.

#

- `HeaderTitle` designed to display a title and an optional subtitle with a link. This component is intended for use in a header or navigation bar where you want to provide a clickable title. This readme documentation will guide you through the usage and functionality of this component.
