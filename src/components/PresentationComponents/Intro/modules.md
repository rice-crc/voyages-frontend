# Intro Components

The `Intro` components represent pages displaying information about various aspects, including voyages, the past, enslaved individuals, and enslavers. These components are designed to present historical information, provide navigation options, and include a credit line.

Here's a simplified explanation common to all Intro components:

1. They import necessary components and data.
2. Display images and introductions related to the respective historical topics.
3. Offer buttons for navigating to different sections of the application.
4. Handle navigation actions, reset state, and clear local storage when buttons are clicked.
5. Include a credit line at the bottom with the current year and artist's name.

There are four specific Intro components:

1. Voyages Intro
2. Past People Intro
3. Enslaved Intro
4. Enslavers Intro

These components serve as introductory pages for different historical contexts within the application.
