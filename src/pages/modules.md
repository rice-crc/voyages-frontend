# PAGES

## Introduction

In the context of the Voyages project, the "pages" folder plays a pivotal role as a designated directory for efficiently managing the various routes or views within your application. Each subfolder housed within the "pages" directory aligns with a distinctive page or section featured on your website or web application.

In our Voyages application, we've meticulously structured our pages in the following manner:

##

## Home page

The "Home" page serves as the primary entry point for our application, providing users with an overview of the project and easy access to various sections.
